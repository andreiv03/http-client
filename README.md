# HTTP Client

A high-performance, modular **C++ HTTP client** designed for seamless client-server communication. This client enables sending HTTP requests, managing responses, and handling various request types efficiently.

Built with an **abstract command pattern**, it ensures **scalability**, **maintainability**, and **extensibility**.

## ✨ Features

✔ **Full HTTP Request Support** – Handles GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests.

✔ **Custom Headers & Authentication** – Allows adding headers (e.g., `Authorization`, `Cookie`).

✔ **JSON Parsing** – Uses `nlohmann::json` for handling request/response payloads.

✔ **TCP Socket Communication** – Implements low-level networking using POSIX sockets.

✔ **Command-Based Architecture** – Uses an abstract command pattern for better organization.

✔ **Efficient Error Handling** – Handles network failures and incorrect responses gracefully.

## ⚡ Technology Stack

- **C++ (C++11 or later)** – Core programming language for high-performance execution.
- **POSIX Sockets** – Enables low-level TCP communication for HTTP requests.
- **nlohmann JSON** – Lightweight and efficient JSON parsing library.
- **Makefile** – Simplifies the build process for compiling the project.
